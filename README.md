===============================

Open index.html in your browser to start the game.  Then use the arrow keys to move your character from the bottom of the screen to the top.  If you hit a bug or allow the bugs to hit you your character will have his position reset to the bottom center space on the game board.  If you are able to reach to top of the game board your character will then reset to the bottom center so that you can play again.  Good Luck.
